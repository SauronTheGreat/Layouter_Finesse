Feature: Demographics for market
  In order to divide population of consumers based in category
  in the market
  I want to design market demographics
#this data is usually seeded.
#it can only be changed by super admin

  Scenario:superadmin creates a new demograhic for a market

  Scenario:superadmin edits a of a market

  Scenario:superadmin deletes  demograhic of a market

  Scenario:superadmin views details about demographics of a market


#these come under validations

  Scenario: some user other than super admin tries to access the market demographic resource



  Scenario: super admin creates  market demograhics without proportion
    #leaving proportion blank

  Scenario: superadmin creates demograhics for a market with proportion not summing upto 100
 #this will be done by java script
